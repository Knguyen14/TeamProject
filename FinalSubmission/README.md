In our Final Submission folder all of our html files and maps will be in the /app folder.
The items like our Final presentation and such will not be in folders and will be 
on the main page of this Final Submission folder. 

To run our web app graders should run the route and the html files locally
and our link to the Heroku site should show what the app looks like
