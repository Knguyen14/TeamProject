Description: Building an interactive app that will help people on the CU campus find the shortest route to their destination. 

Vision Statement: Making life on campus a whole lot quicker

Motivation: We understand that getting around on campus isn't a easy thing, and can be very confusing. So hopefully with this app we can help with that. 

Risks: 1. Not very experienced coders.
       2. Making sure we can all work together, and our schedules work together. 

Mitigation Strategy: Planning out the project accordingly, and giving each team member equally difficult tasks.
